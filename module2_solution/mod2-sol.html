    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><P class="positioning" id="wine">wine</P>
    <span><p> Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide and heat. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. </p></span></div>
